I choose LastPass as my password manager. I looked at Lockwise, 1Password and LastPass. I began by just looking up the best password managers and LastPass was recommended as having one of the best security and supporting multiple platforms. I also looked at Lockwise but since I do not use Firefox, I choose not to get that one. I also looked at 1Password but it was on less devices than LastPass so I picked that.
